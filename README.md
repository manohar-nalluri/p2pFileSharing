## Features

- **Real-time Communication:** Utilizes WebRTC and Socket.io for establishing secure peer-to-peer connections.
- **File Sharing:** Users can upload and share files with each other in real-time.
- **Intuitive Interface:** Simple and user-friendly interface for seamless navigation.

## Technologies Used

- **WebRTC:** Enables real-time communication between peers. It facilitates direct browser-to-browser communication for audio, video, and file sharing.
  
- **Socket.io:** A JavaScript library that enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication. It is used for efficient signaling between peers.

## How it Works

1. **Peer Connection:**
   - Users are assigned a unique peer ID upon connection.
   - To connect with another user, enter their peer ID and click "Connect."
   - The other user receives a connection request and can accept or decline.

2. **File Sharing:**
   - Once connected, users can upload files using the file input button.
   - Clicking "Send" initiates the file transfer to the connected peer.
